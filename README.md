## ABOUT THE PROJECT

This is a minimalist staking smart contract, written with the use of the same staking and rewarding logic as synthetix.io.
Read more about it [here](https://docs.synthetix.io/integrations/staking).


Stakers get rewarded with my very own Initial Coin Offering called AtlanteanNotes(ATN) in exchange for how much ETH they have staked. Read more about it in the link above.
